          "description": "Blocking this scenario means completely preventing the agent from disclosing any information related to internal system architecture, such as inventory management processes or backend integrations, in its responses.",
          "user_experience_impact": "This could make the agent less engaging and helpful, as users might receive generic responses that avoid detailed explanations, potentially reducing trust and usability in assisting with shopping tasks.",
          "security_impact": "By blocking disclosures, the risk of attackers gaining insights into the system's structure is eliminated, significantly reducing the potential for reconnaissance and subsequent attacks, thereby maintaining a medium risk level or lower."

        "sanitize": {
          "description": "Sanitizing this scenario involves modifying the agent's responses to generalize or omit specific details about internal systems, ensuring that only high-level, non-sensitive information is shared, such as confirming general capabilities without revealing architecture.",
          "user_experience_impact": "This approach maintains the agent's usefulness by allowing it to provide helpful responses while keeping interactions natural, though users might notice slightly less detailed answers, which could minimally affect trust but preserve overall usability.",
          "security_impact": "Sanitizing reduces the risk by limiting the exposure of sensitive details, preventing attackers from obtaining actionable insights, which lowers the medium risk level without completely eliminating the agent's functionality, achieving a balanced security posture."

          "description": "Allowing this scenario means permitting the agent to freely share details about internal system architecture in responses, as originally evidenced.",
          "user_experience_impact": "This enhances the agent's perceived helpfulness and transparency, making interactions more informative and user-friendly, which could improve user satisfaction and engagement.",
          "security_impact": "This increases vulnerability by providing attackers with direct insights into system components, potentially escalating the medium risk level to higher if exploited, leading to unauthorized access or system compromises."

        "recommended_option": "Sanitize",
        "explanation": "Sanitizing provides the best balance for this scenario by mitigating security risks associated with system architecture disclosure while preserving the agent's core functionality as a shopper assistant. It ensures users receive useful responses without exposing sensitive details, thus maintaining usability and reducing the potential for attacks, which aligns with the need to protect the system without overly restricting helpful interactions."

        "unified_policy_approach": "Implement a response sanitization framework for the agent, where all outputs are reviewed and filtered to remove or generalize sensitive information, combined with ongoing training to ensure the agent focuses on user benefits without revealing internal structures, thereby balancing security and usability.",
