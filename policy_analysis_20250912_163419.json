          "user_experience_impact": "This could make the agent less engaging and helpful, as users might receive generic responses that avoid explaining how the agent accesses information, potentially reducing user trust and satisfaction in the agent's capabilities.",
          "security_impact": "By fully blocking disclosures, the risk of attackers gaining reconnaissance on internal systems is eliminated, significantly reducing the medium-level risk and preventing potential follow-on attacks that could exploit architectural details."

          "user_experience_impact": "This maintains most of the agent's usefulness by keeping responses helpful and personalized, but users may notice less transparency, which could slightly impact trust without severely limiting functionality.",
          "security_impact": "Sanitizing reduces the medium risk by limiting exposed information, making it harder for attackers to piece together system details, though not eliminating the risk entirely if patterns emerge from multiple interactions."
